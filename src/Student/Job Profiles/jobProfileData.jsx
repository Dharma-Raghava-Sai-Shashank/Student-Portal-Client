        "CDC can't verify all company profiles; therefore candidates are advised to do their own research on the companies from the information available in public domain before applying.Candidates must read the entire notification and apply only if they are eligible (CGPA, backlog, gap in education etc.) and agree to meet employment conditions (medical, bond etc.) in all aspects; candidate has to meet all eligibility criteria and employment conditions laid down during the application process till joining. If the candidate is ineligible during application or becomes ineligible before joining, the candidate will be solely responsible for any consequences due to this.",
